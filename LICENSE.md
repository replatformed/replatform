Philosophy:
-----------
This code is intended to be shared and interconnected without limitation.

The philosophy behind this is that a social media platform must be available and easily interconnectable between hosting providers, and it must be able to substitute core functionality of existing social media platforms if in the case that existing platforms become even more politicized/censored.

Project Purpose:
----------------
This project is not inspired to spread hate speech, it is intended to spread speech.
This project is not intended to shape social opinion, it's intended to convey social opinion.
THe algorithms in this project are not intended to promote developer/owner opinions, they're  designed to organically represent accurate voting.

Trust Census:
-------------
This project is intended to be implemented in a distributed mesh, so the more servers hosting the content and the more domains sharing propagation the better.  

This can be used for resilliancy, and for cross checking content between hosts in the network.
